Would you rather is a fun icebreaker game where a host is able to generate a quiz. Users are given the option to select between two options, This or That.

At the end of the quiz the host will receive the results to show the users what they answered.

What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)

This is a great icebreaker that opens up conversation for a group of people. It helps display commonalities between users. This is a great team building exercise to use for users who want to create interaction among a group of people.
