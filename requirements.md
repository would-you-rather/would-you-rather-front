## VISION

The pain point this project solve is creating a welcoming environment for users. The product can encourage communication between individuals to allow individuals to learn more about each other. This project also solves bonding between people.
This product is important because it allows individuals to connect on common interests. This product also helps people get to know each other, especially if someone isn't good at socializing, so this is an excellent way for everyone to feel included. 

## SCOPE IN/OUT

## IN

Would you rather is a fun icebreaker game where a host is able to generate a quiz. Users are given the option to select between two options, This or That.
The individual features that our product will do are taking in user input, generating new questions, and displaying final results. 
High overview of each: creating an auth0 for user login, generating new questions after each round for users to answer, the user will be able to click “next” to see new questions, and the host of the game will be able to end the game.

## OUT  - 

Our game will never turn into an IOS or Android app giving control to the user.

## Minimum Viable Product vs

Our MVP functionality will be generating new questions and seeing final results. 
Our stretch goal will be changing the question category and displaying live results using Socket.io.

## Functionality Requirements

 Allowing user to login
Generating new questions every round
Keeping track of user answers.

## Non-Functionality Requirements

Generating new questions using an API is not a functionality requirement because we will be able to create our own questions. Another non-functional requirement is using auth0 for the user to log in.
